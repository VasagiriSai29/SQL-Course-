Basics concepts of SQL

Before going into SQL, first let's learn about the basic terms of SQL. 

Database :- Database is the collection of data, in the format that can be easily accessed digitally. 

For instance Companies like Goggle, Microsoft, Facebook, Instagram. If we go & Create an account on Instagram, it will have our email, Password, & Photos & Many more. It will be strored in Database. In this way it forms a collection of our data, which can be accessed easily i.e we can search for particular dataif we need, adding new data, deleting data. 

Generally Our data is stored in digital format. In our Computer systems data will be stored in a digital format. 

A Software application used to manage our DB is called as Data Base Management Systems(DBMS). DBMS acts as a layer between user & Database. SQL is used to interact with DBMS.

Types of Databases

Relational Databases :- Data Stored in tables. Example :- In School, Class teacher used to maintain a register in it we have Rollno's & Names. In the same way if data is stored digitally, we call that data as Relational Database. We call them as RDBMS. Few examples of RDBMS are MYSQL,ORACLE, Microsoft SQL Server, Postgre SQL.

Non Relational Databases :- Data not stored in tables. We also call it as NO-SQL Databases, because these wont be able to understand SQL. Most Popular one mangoDB.
